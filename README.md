MultiTask Pre-Training for E-Commerce Product Search   
   
**1.Abstract:**     
In pre-training stage, we adopt mlm task, classification task and contrastive learning task to achieve considerably performance.    
In fine-tuning stage, we use confident learning, exponential moving average method (EMA), adversarial training (FGM) and regularized dropout strategy (R-Drop) to improve the model's generalization and robustness.    
Moreover, we use a multi-granular semantic unit to discover the queries and products textual metadata for enhancing the representation of the model.   ∂∂ 
Our approach obtained competitive results and ranked top-8 in three tasks.       ∂
